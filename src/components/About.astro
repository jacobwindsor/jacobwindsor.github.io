          I combine deep domain expertise in genomics and bioinformatics with
          modern software engineering practices. I've built systems that process
          petabytes of biological data, designed platforms supporting thousands
          of researchers worldwide, and led teams to deliver high-impact
          solutions that accelerate scientific discovery.
